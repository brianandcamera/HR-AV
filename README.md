# HR-AV
A **WIP** Windows Desktop Anti-Virus application based on the same custom anti-virus engine that secures the HonestRepair Cloud. Runs on 32 or 64 bit Windows systems. A very early work-in-process.

# Built with HTA-UI
This application is also a showcase for the powerful [HTA-UI](https://github.com/zelon88/HR-AI) platform. Currently it does not work in any capacity and it will probably stay that way until Tuesday, August 20th when I'll have time to get it running.

# In the meantime
Please take a look at the HTA-UI repo and try your hand at writing **Windows Desktop Applications in Minutes!**
